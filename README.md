The system acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and Peripheral Capillary Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) signals through the MAX98101 sensor and ECG electrodes interfaced with Raspberry Pi’s ADC (via an external ADC module MCP3008). The Raspberry Pi performs digital signal processing (filtering, normalization, and R-peak detection) using MATLAB for signal processing and Python-based algorithms. Features such as R-peak amplitude, RR interval, and speed, along with patient metadata (age, gender), are extracted.
These features are passed to a machine learning classifier (decision tree) trained and validated on labelled  ECG datasets. The trained model categorizes cardiac conditions as Normal, Bradycardia, Tachycardia, or Ventricular Tachycardia. The Raspberry Pi then displays the results (pulse rate + prediction) on an OLED display in real time.
This standalone Raspberry Pi system eliminates the need for a PC backend, enabling compact, low-cost, and intelligent cardiac monitoring, with potential applications in IoT healthcare and telemedicine.
